# Oliwier Szymański  
*Junior BI Analyst | Precision Analytics for Finance and Economics*

With a self-taught foundation in Python since age 13 and hands-on experience in financial modeling, I deliver data-driven solutions that uncover hidden patterns and mitigate risks in high-stakes environments. Specializing at the intersection of machine learning, BI visualization, and economic forecasting, I build robust tools—from LSTM networks for FOREX predictions to ML classifiers for loan risk—that enable institutions to make informed, efficient decisions. My recent DataCamp Data Engineer certification (March 2025) and virtual consulting with Accenture underscore a commitment to scalable ETL pipelines and stakeholder-ready insights.

Pursuing CFA Level I, I stay attuned to market dynamics, from cross-border economic trends to investment critiques, ensuring my analytics align with strategic financial imperatives.


## Technical Proficiency
Proven in end-to-end workflows: from data ingestion and optimization to deployment and visualization.
